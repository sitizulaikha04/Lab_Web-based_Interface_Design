      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Universiti Malaysia Terengganu (University of Malaysia, Terengganu) or UMT,
         formerly known as Kolej Universiti Sains dan Teknologi Malaysia 
        (Malaysian University College of Science and Technology) or KUSTEM, is 
        a university in Kuala Nerus District, Terengganu, Malaysia. It was 
        officially chartered on 1 February 2007.</p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>Universiti Malaysia Terengganu began as Universiti Pertanian Malaysia's Centre 
        for Fisheries and Marine Science, located at Mengabang Telipot, Kuala Terengganu. 
        It provided facilities for both students and lecturers from the Fisheries and Marine Science 
        programmes to conduct their practical sessions and also researches.</p>
      <p>Eventually, the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Science of Universiti 
        Pertanian Malaysia (UPM) in Serdang was transferred to Kuala Terengganu, and the Centre 
        transformed into a branch campus, being renamed Universiti Pertanian Malaysia Terengganu 
        (UPMT) in June 1996. The name of the faculty was also changed to the 
        Faculty of Applied Sciences and Technology. Also formed were the Faculty of Science 
        and Professional Literature and the Matriculation Centre.</p>
      <p>Later on, the Cabinet of Malaysia had approved the establishment of Terengganu University 
        College (KUT) on 5 May 1999 as an associate campus of UPM.
         Then Terengganu Universiti College was given autonomy on 1 May 2001 and was renamed 
         Kolej Universiti Sains dan Teknologi Malaysia (KUSTEM) on 20 June 2001.</p>
      <p>On 1 February 2007, KUSTEM was given the status of a full-fledged university, and 
        with that elevation, it was renamed again and remain to this very day as 
        Universiti Malaysia Terengganu. At the same time, KUSTEM's emblem was rehashed as 
        the University's emblem.</p>
      <p>In 2015, the university is granted autonomy status.</p>
